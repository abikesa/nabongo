    "Ah, if you're interested in analytic decisions rather than raters' reliability, the use of ICC takes on a different flavor. The decision to use hierarchical models or ordinary regression largely depends on the structure of your data and the specific research questions you are asking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchical Models\n",
    "Hierarchical models are particularly useful when your data has multiple levels of grouping, such as patients within hospitals or repeated measurements on the same subjects over time. They allow you to explicitly model variance at each level of the hierarchy, which can give you deeper insights into the data. If the ICC is close to zero, this would suggest that the hierarchical structure might not be providing much information beyond what you'd get with an ordinary regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordinary Regression\n",
    "In contrast, ordinary regression doesn't account for hierarchical structure. If your ICC is zero, this might indicate that ordinary regression is sufficient for your needs since the grouping in your hierarchical data doesn't contribute to the variance in your dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Research ICCs**: Given that you're focused on analytic decisions, an ICC of 0 could simplify your analytic approach. You might find that ordinary regression models are sufficient for your research questions. Random effects models may not reveal additional nuances if the ICC is zero.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immediate Objectives**: Conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis to ensure that an ordinary regression model would be sufficient. Validate the assumptions behind ordinary regression with your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Long-term Objectives**: If ordinary regression is found to be sufficient, you could focus on enriching those models with additional predictors or interaction terms to better answer your research questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, given that your interest lies in analytic decisions and not in rater reliability, an ICC of 0 could actually simplify your analytic strategy. It suggests that treating your data hierarchically may not provide additional benefits over a simpler ordinary regression model."
