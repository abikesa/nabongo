    "Ah, if you're interested in analytic decisions rather than raters' reliability, the use of ICC takes on a different flavor. The decision to use hierarchical models or ordinary regression largely depends on the structure of your data and the specific research questions you are asking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical models are particularly useful when your data has multiple levels of grouping, such as patients within hospitals or repeated measurements on the same subjects over time. They allow you to explicitly model variance at each level of the hierarchy, which can give you deeper insights into the data. If the ICC is close to zero, this would suggest that the hierarchical structure might not be providing much information beyond what you'd get with an ordinary regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, given that your interest lies in analytic decisions and not in rater reliability, an ICC of 0 could actually simplify your analytic strategy. It suggests that treating your data hierarchically may not provide additional benefits over a simpler ordinary regression model.\n",
